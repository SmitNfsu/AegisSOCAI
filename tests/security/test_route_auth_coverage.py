"""Route inventory: every /api/* route must require auth or be on the
explicit public allowlist.

Locks in the deny-by-default contract introduced after the 2026-05
security disclosure. If you add a new router or route without auth,
this test fails — and the fix is either to add ``dependencies=AUTH_DEPENDENCY``
to the include_router call (or ``Depends(get_current_active_user)`` to
the handler) or, if the route is intentionally public, to add it to
``PUBLIC_API_PATHS`` in ``services/api/main.py``.

Adding a route to ``PUBLIC_API_PATHS`` is a security decision, not a way
to make this test quiet. A feature-flagged inbound webhook receiver that
shows up here because it was mounted unconditionally must be fixed by
restoring the flag, not by allowlisting the path.

Traversal note (issue #532): FastAPI >= 0.137 no longer flattens child
routes into ``app.routes``. It stores lazy ``_IncludedRouter`` entries,
which have no ``.path`` attribute, so the ``for route in app.routes``
loop this test used to run examined 1 route out of 357 — ``/api/health``,
already on the allowlist — and passed unconditionally. Because
``requirements.txt`` had no upper bound on ``fastapi``, a transitive
upgrade disarmed the gate with no visible signal.
``_collect_api_routes`` walks both table shapes, and
``test_route_inventory_reaches_every_documented_path`` fails if the walk
ever goes stale against a future version.
