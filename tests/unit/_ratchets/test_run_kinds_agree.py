"""The run-kind vocabulary is declared twice and must say the same thing.

Python enqueues a job naming a run kind; TypeScript validates it against a closed
union and resolves it to an arch. Nothing checked the two lists agreed, and they
had already drifted -- TypeScript carried ``tally`` and Python did not, so a
conformance run could be enqueued by hand and refused, or a kind added on one
side reached production missing from the other.
