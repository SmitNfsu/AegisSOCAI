"""One egress: every LLM call leaves through Bifrost, on one schema.

ADR 0011 decided this and nothing enforced it. `main` reached models four ways —
llm_gateway, llm_router, llm_format, llm_clients — plus provider-specific paths
inside claude_service and openai_agent_service. That count was not designed: each
was the reasonable local choice for one caller, and review did not stop it
reaching four.

A constraint that matters is expressed as something that fails.
